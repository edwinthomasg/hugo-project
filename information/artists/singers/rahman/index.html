Rahman began learning piano at the age of four and assisted his father in the studio.</p><p>When Rahman was nine, his father passed away. Rahman who was then studying in Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan started working to support his family. Furthermore, the family rented out his father&rsquo;s musical instruments to earn a living.<br> 
As Rahman was working hard to make the ends meet, he failed the exams. Mrs. YGP, the then principal of the school summoned his mother and told her to take him to the streets of Kodambakkam to beg and not to send him to the school anymore.</p><p>Post this incident, Rahman attended MCN for a year and then Madras Christian College Higher Secondary School. However, Rahman dropped out of school with the permission of his mother to pursue a career in music. </p><b>Total Pages :</b> Pages(0)<hr><ul></ul><img src=rahman.jpg alt="image not found" style=width:350px;height:280px>
